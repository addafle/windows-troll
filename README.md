I am NOT responsible for how you intend on using my project, if you consider using it is entirely your own risk!

What is it
---
This is a file that is supposed to make it look like your computer is being attacked by a virus. It was constructed using only resources from the windows operating system (Notepad, Batch files, VBS files, and .exe) The main file is a VBS file and it activates the other batch files. This tool DOES NOT cause any harm to the computer it is run on and does not contain any malicious code.

What the file executes in chronological order
---
* Opens a text document and begins writing a fake virus message.

* Runs CMD with a spam of red numbers.

* Another 4 CMD windows pop up with red skeleton faces on them.

* Opens a CMD and writes "Goodbye System32...".

* Signs the user out of the computer.

How to run/use the file
---
This file is mainly meant for trolling purposes. If you download it and want to use it as it is, you can delete the vbs file and use the exe file to run the batch files. If you want to customize it, delete the exe and edit the vbs. Once you are finished editing the vbs, you can use a program called "VBS to EXE" to convert it back to an exe again. The reason you want to delete the vbs is because if you put it on someone's computer they can right-click it and click edit and they can see all the code inside. However, if it's an exe they can't see the code. Furthermore, this will not get detected by any antivirus program as it does not contain any malicious code.
